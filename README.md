# AkkaSampleWiki
Collection of projects implementing different pattern/tools from Akka. Because there are many examples, but all of them showcase different app, which can make comparison kinda difficult between them, all examples in here are based on the same base project (sports betting platform). This is not meant to be a real life application. It's for showcasing and discovering things with Akka and Scala to get a better understanding what is going on and what kind of pattern / tools would be benefitial in some cases.
Projects are located at the representative branch e.g. withenforcedreplies for a app with usage of enforced replies. See TODO's for information about open tasks. These will be updated in the future.
